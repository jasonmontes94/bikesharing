# Bikesharing

## Overview

We must provide a solid analysis in order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We have used Tableau in order to create a set of visualizations that would be used for the proposal.

## Results

![tripduration.png](/Resources/tripduration.png)

From this line graph, we see that most trips take less than 10 minutes. Hardly any trips last longer than an hour.

![tripsbygender.png](/Resources/tripsbygender.png)

Similar to the first line graph, this graph demonstrates how much time each gender spends per trip on average. Men seem to make more trips, and for longer, than women.

![tripsbyweekdayperhour.png](/Resources/tripsbyweekdayperhour.png)

This heat map shows that the most popular times for any trip are commuting hours, such as in the morning from 7AM-9AM, and in the late afternoon to evening at 5PM-7PM.

![tripsbygender_weekdayperhour.png](/Resources/tripsbygender_weekdayperhour.png)

These heat maps show the most popular times by gender. While similar, it is apparent that men seem to use the bikes more during commuting hours (7AM-9AM, and 5PM-7PM).

![tripsbygender_byweekday.png](/Resources/tripsbygender_byweekday.png)

This heat map shows the amount of trips per gender, as well as type of user. Subscribers seem to make more trips, particularly male subscribers.

## Summary

From these visualizations, it is apparent that in order to be successful in Des Moines we must market rides to women. Men are more likely to ride bikes in any regard, especially during commuting hours. We can also maximize business by providing bike stations in high traffic areas.

Here is a map that shows the most popular start locations in New York City.

This map shows the most popular end locations. Comparing these two maps, we can see that tourist locations and places of business are the most popular start and end locations. If we can provide bike stations in places tourists gather, as well as business districts, we can maximize the usage of our bikes by our customers and subscribers!
